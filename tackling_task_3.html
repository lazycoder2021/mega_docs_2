        <h3>How I Tackled Writing The MEGA Cloud Storage Webpage II Task? <a href="index.html">[Go Back]</a></h3>
        <p>This time I wanted to target enterprises. Not personal users. Because MEGA seems to have a decent remote collaboration tool for enterprises. In fact, based on my little research I felt that you are one of the few cloud storage services which also offers a video conferencing app. But only you can confirm this.</p>
        
        <br/>
        <h3>Steps Involved </h3>  
        
        <ul>
            <li>Wanted to highlight video/audio conferencing, therefore made it the subheader. </li>
            <li>Mentioned that video meeting happens via MEGA's own video tool, not via integration with 3rd party tools like Zoom, in the description. </li>
            <li>And since there are 2 CTAs, highlighted the one this page is meant for, that is Business, while dimming the other one by giving it a transparent background.</li>
            <li>Made sure cloud storage features were explained in line with enterprise employees' needs</li>
            <li>Added another CTA which emphatically states the number of registered MEGA users</li>
            <li>Indicated the types of companies that can use MEGA (of course, this is just guesswork)</li>
            <li>Listed those who have critically acclaimed MEGA to add credibility to the web page</li>
                        
        </ul>
