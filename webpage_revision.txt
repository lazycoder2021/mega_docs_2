Rewriting and Reformatting Needed 
==================================

Add separate pointers for what you found impressive and why did you find them so

Also check all the titles -- maybe you can modify a few of them 

Also come up with another page, that does away with the technical jargon and has a humane touch to it, so that it connects with the readers well 

1. more description needed (before Try Mega for Free) button (especially coz mega deploys tight security features) 
	
	WHY? 

	- good place to add keywords (since its the topmost section of the page) and make the webpage rank well 
	- to gain user trust
	- to display how robust MEGA's security is

2. Download files using links with no need to sign up -- sentence needs to be modified

	WHY? 

	- not the signed up user's benefit 
	- moreover, the title might be a bit misleading, making uninitiated users think they don't have to sign up at all to use Mega 

3. more descripton needed (after the transfer manager easily manages...description)  

	WHY?
	
	- useful features like this can improve site traffic, therefore need to be explained in short sentences
	- moreover, the uninitiated user might not know what a scheduled transfer is, especially since the MEGA user persona seems to cover users of all ages split into 2 broad categories (those who know how to use a computer/app and those who don't/are first timers) 

4. descripton needs to be modified 

	WHY? 

        - mostly for minor language related issues
	- 'put the power' seems a bit odd, 'give the power' might sound better 
	- 'to all your data at all times' seems a bit odd, because of 2 consecutive 'alls', instead access to your data at all times would sound better

=======================================================================================================================

approach involved 

1. reading the existing copy as the end user (which is quite easy for me at the moment) 

2. noticing what grabs the eye (and checking whether it aligns with Mega's core) 

3. reading and rereading content to understand mega jargon (every app has its own jargon) and looking at options to improve readability


design process

1. using html/css, keeping it minimal, close to the original 
 

writing process

4. keywords research (use ubersuggest) 

3. ensuring keywords go into the first 100-150 words of the copy 

5. final grammarly check for grammer errors, hemingwayapp for readability test, reading out the copy aloud
