        <h3>How I Tackled Writing The MEGA Cloud Storage Webpage I Task? <a href="index.html">[Go Back]</a></h3>
        <p>By now, I had gotten acquainted with the core features of MEGA's cloud storage. And this time I wanted to create a conversational webpage which adopted a casual tone. The idea was to create a typical web page copy that did go overboard with its claims, nor did it downplay the same.</p>
         <br/>
        <h3>Steps Involved </h3>  
        
        <ul>
            <li>Wanted to present a gist of all the core cloud storage related security features in one go </li>
            <li>Therefore listed them as subheadings to the title containing the keyword 'secure cloud storage' </li>
            <li>Also wanted to bring to reader's attention the types of MEGA users: Individuals and Enterprises</li>
            <li>Therefore listed the pricing model related features for these 2 users, so that the reader gets curious about them and maybe checks out the pricing page later</li>
            <li>The CTA remained the same -- button leading the user to at least register for the free account </li>
            <li>Centered all the banner text so it catches the readers' eye the moment they land on the page</li>
        
            <li>Then elaborated on each and every storage related feature using 4-5 liners</li>
            <li>Ensured apt inter-linking within the website. For example, checkout pricing page link, mega mobile and desktop app links.</li>
            
        </ul>
