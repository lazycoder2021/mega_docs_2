        <h3>How I Tackled Writing The MEGA Cloud Storage Webpage Task? <a href="index.html">[Go Back]</a></h3>
        <p>To create a webpage for any online business, one has to gain a good understanding of the following: i) the tone that the business prefers, ii) the colors employed by the business for its branding, and iii) the style of writing/design which the business prefers or adopts.</p>
        <p>To gain a good understanding of all of this first, I set about updating the existing MEGA Cloud Storage page, instead of creating a new one from scratch. (Of course, one can come up with a completely new design, especially when it comes to a webpage surrounding a specific campaign that would be taken down once the campaign ends, but that was not the task assigned to me).</p>
        <p>This was how I eventually tackled the task of writing the MEGA cloud storage webpage. And though I was asked to write only one, I chose to write 2 different versions of it, keeping in mind the tone, style, colors, and the kind of images that the makers of the MEGA website seem to prefer.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>How I Tackled The Task Of Updating The Existing MEGA Cloud Storage Page? </h3>  
        <p>Note: the updates I made to the page are marked in red</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read and re-read the copy to understand what was on offer </li>
            <li>Did my own little research to find out what MEGA's strongpoint was -- and found out that it was the cloud-storage-related security </li>
            <li>And felt that it was not being projected enough on the web page</li>
            <li>And since security and cloud-storage seems to be closely knit in the case of MEGA, set about updating the storage page with the security features MEGA had to offer</li>
            <li>Moreover, the security topic seemed to offer a good organic way of inserting keywords like end-to-end encryption, protection against ransomware, etc right at the top of the page, which can eventually boost the page's ranking</li>
            <li>This is how the first two sections of the page were handled: the banner and the features section</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Justification for other updates you see on the page</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The page talks about massive cloud storage, but it does not specify the exact amount</li>
            <li>Felt that the statement was not backed by the fact -- the fact being 20+ GB storage which is way more than what the competitors seem to offer</li>
            <li>Plus, it also allowed me to link to the user achievements program webpage you have. </li>
            <li>Any kind of sensible interlinking to an already well-performing website (this I found out after running MEGA through Ubersuggest) is no doubt good</li>
            <li>Modified 'Download files using links with no need to sign up' to 'File Download Made Easy': especially since this was not a direct MEGA user benefit, but a benefit of the recipient of the mega user's file. And added a line that emphasized MEGA's security instead, while maintaining the non-mega user's benefit in the description.</li>
            <li>Removed the 'scheduled file transfers' line and explicitly stated that interrupted transfers (due to network issues) will be queued/scheduled and executed later when the user gets back to the network since the 'scheduled transfer' term might seem too techy for the uninitiated user. Simplified this line especially since MEGA's user persona seems to be a diverse one covering people of all ages and intellects.</li>
            
        </ul>
