                <h2>My Writing Process In General <a href="index.html">[Go Back]</a></h2>
                <p>1. Extensive Research -- the first step to any kind of writing. Doing extensive research about the topic at hand, until I have enough information (to write) and also feel confident that the collected info is credible. </p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">How do I check credibility? – the easiest way is to search online, also look into the company's website (web pages) and also into the knowledge base (if I am writing for an app or a software product, this is where you can easily confirm tech stuff). </p>
                <p>2. Individual Brainstorming: Thinking about what I am going to write, what the content will be about, and how to make it impressive (jotting down a few stand-out points) -- basically a collection of ideas that need to be structured. </p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">I also do a bit of free writing here. This helps me get my thoughts flowing and gain confidence about what I am about to write. </p>
                <p>3. Planning: Then, to structure the collected ideas, will create the skeleton for the write-up </p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">This will usually be a list of bulleted points (mostly containing headers and sub-headers for the write-up, along with some notes for me)</p>
                <p>4. Writing: Once I have got the structure right, I start writing -- I prefer a clean blank writing environment (like the one provided by MS Word or calmly writer), where it's just me and my words (and of course, the reference material which I'd picked up after research) until I get the write up done</p>
                <p>5. Reviewing the write-up and final checks</p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">Simple re-reading</p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">Reading the write-up out aloud</p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">Running the write-up through grammar checks (I prefer Grammarly for this)</p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">Checking the write-up for readability (I prefer HemingwayApp + Grammarly for this)</p>
                <p>6. Finally modify the format of the content, if necessary (like I did here, turning it into a simple web page that can be published).</p>
