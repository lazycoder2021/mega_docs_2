        <p style="margin-top:50px;"><b>Tools I Used To Create These Pages</b></p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">HTML for creating the web page markup</p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">CSS for designing the web page (though I am not a skilled designer, you can probably see that I can put up a decent design)</p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">Ubersuggest for checking for some keywords and MEGA website performance</p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">Windows Snipping tool for capturing some images</p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">Grammarly for checking the write-up's grammar</p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">Hemingway App for checking the write-up's readability score</p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">GitHub for publishing the web page (not GitHub proficient, but someone who knows how to use it)</p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">Netlify for hosting the web page for free (although the same can be done using GitHub itself)</p>

        <p><b>Note:</b> These web pages are not mobile responsive. You have to use your laptop to view them properly. (Though I know how to make a web page mobile responsive, I refrained from doing so, since this is basically a test of my writing skills) </p>
        <p><b>A Couple of points I'd like to mention:</b></p>
        <p>Though your website performance is really good (this I found out by running it through UberSuggest), you seem to be overlooking these: </p>
        <p style="margin-left:30px;">The naming of your URLs: for example, <a href="https://mega.nz/storage">https://mega.nz/storage. </a>This is good, but you could be more specific here, like https://mega.nz/storage/about-mega-secure-cloud-storage.html. The more specific (and reader-friendly) you get, the better would be your website performance. [Do correct me if I am wrong here]. </p>
        <p style="margin-left:30px">The naming of your images: for example, <a href="https://sg.static.mega.co.nz/4/imagery/picture-features-storage-header-abefccf36712ba22_desktop.png">https://sg.static.mega.co.nz/4/imagery/picture-features-storage-header-abefccf36712ba22_desktop.png</a> The image name contains a string of random alpha-numeric characters. Moreover, the name doesn't seem to fit in contextually. If it had read, 'mega-cloud-storage' or 'mega-cloud-drive', it would be beneficial. Especially from the SEO point of view, since both are your keywords.</p>
